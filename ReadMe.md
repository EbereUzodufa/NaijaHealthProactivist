# Overview

This is an awareness design for a friend to enlighten youths especially those in the rural areas of Nigeria. I had to rush it so she can make the proper awareness. As usual, there was a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/VjSlxYmnCCHasgz7osLzXmKr/PledgeGen?node-id=17%3A2) so I can see the alignments of the final card. The idea is to have participants download the pledge image card after they fill out their details and click the submit button.

#The Project
The project consists of

1. index.html - This is the main page. It contains HTML, CSS, and JS.
2. mockup.html - This shows the mockup of the pledge image card looks like when download.
3. html2canvas.js - This file is found in the assets folder. This is the library makes it possible to convert a certain part of HTML to picture. You can read about it [here](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/).

>**NB**: Javascript in the index.html is used to control the transfer of data from the form to the pledge image card.
>This application was made to be responsive and was designed mobile up. Media queries did the magic.
